# odin-recipes
This is a recipe collection created for the Odin Project's [recipe assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes). It demonstrates basic HTML and git management skills.
## Personal Reflection
As I already had some basic HTML knowledge, actually making the website was easy. What surprised me was how difficult it was to write good commit messages. That's something I'll have to get better at, as well as committing earlier and in smaller increments.
