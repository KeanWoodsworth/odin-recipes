        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This simple beverage is perfect for hot days! It's quick, hydrating, and delightfully toothsome. The low-acid fruits and oat milk give it a mellow base, which is complimented by the sweet jam and tangy yogurt.</p>
        <p>More than the sum of its parts, this smoothie is filling and refreshing!</p>

      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>I've found that oat milk works best in this recipe, but you can substitute any other kind of milk.</p>
      <p>I'm sure that citrus marmalade would be excellent in this, but I haven't tried it yet.</p>
