    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Here's a little something to keep you warm and fed during spring! Using native Californian plants, we're taking classic dorm food into a whole new realm with no added cost!<br>Unless you use eggs, in which case you're financially screwed.</p>
    <p>Chickweed and cranesbill are hardy volunteer plants that can be found in both urban and rural areas. They are texturally interesting and mild in taste, which balances the tangy broth and tender noodles. An egg lends umami, completing the dish.</p>
    <p><strong>Safety note:</strong> This recipe requires foraging, which is a learned skill. Do not attempt without a proper guide and positive identification!</p>
