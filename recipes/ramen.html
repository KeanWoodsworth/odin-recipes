          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>Here's a little something to keep you warm and fed during spring! Using native Californian plants, we're taking classic dorm food into a whole new realm with no added cost!<br>Unless you use eggs, in which case you're financially screwed.</p>
          <p>Chickweed and cranesbill are hardy volunteer plants that can be found in both urban and rural areas. They are texturally interesting and mild in taste, which balances the sharp broth and tender noodles. An egg lends umami, completing the dish.</p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>(1 block) Ramen noodles</li>
        <li>(&half; packet) Ramen salt packet</li>
        <li>(1 handfull) Chickweed and/or cranesbill</li>

        <li>(1 tsp) Rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>(&half; tbsp) Sesame oil</li>

      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>Although the greens are edible outside of spring, they're best when tender. I prefer the chickweed (it's crisp and lacy) but the cranesbill is leafier and hardier.</p>
      <p>If you don't have rice wine vinegar, you can substitute &frac14; tsp apple cider vinegar.</p>
      <p>The sesame oil can be substituted for olive oil.</p>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Harvest tender greens using a sharp knife. Rinse well and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add water, &half; salt packet, and vinegar to a soup pot. Bring to a light boil.</li>
        <li>Using a ladle, drop in the un-cracked eggs. Boil for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the greens. Boil for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add the ramen noodles and oil. Boil for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>After the eggs have been in for 6 minutes, they're done. Remove from the broth and cool on a clean towel.</li>
        <li>Take the pot off the stove.</li>
        <li>Run the eggs under cool water. Roll on the towel to carefully crack and peel the shell.</li>
        <li>Ladle soup into the bowl. Once you're ready to eat, add an egg.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
