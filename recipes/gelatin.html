    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Well here's something different! A chewy, savory gelatin dish that may be entirely my own making. This easy and novel treat will take your mind off our crapsack world, like you're a depressed zoo animal in dire need of enrichment. And really, aren't we all?</p>
    <p>I won't lie, this one's mostly about texture, otherwise you'd just drink a cup of tea. But why drink water when you could bite it?</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>(4 bags) Earl grey tea</li>
      <li>(4 tbsp) Unflavored gelatin</li>
      <li>(3 cups) Filtered water</li>
      <li>(1 cup) Cold coconut milk</li>
      <li>(&frac18;&ndash;&frac14; cup) Sugar, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>You can use any type of herbal tea, but savory is best. Matcha is excellent, but you may need to add more sugar to balance the bitterness.</p>
    <p>Any kind of milk works just fine for this recipe.</p>

      <li>Sprinkle the gelatin over the milk. Go slowly!</li>

      <li>While the tea steeps, mash the bloomed gelatin with a whisk to break up any clumps.</li>
      <li>Wait until the tea is just cool enough to sip, remove the bags, then pour into the mixing bowl.</li>
      <li>Whisk the mixture until the gelatin is dissolved.</li>
