  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Well here's something different! A chewy, savory gelatin dish that may be entirely my own making. This easy and novel treat will take your mind off our crapsack world, like you're a depressed zoo animal in dire need of enrichment. And really, aren't we all?</p>
  <p>I won't lie, this one's mostly about texture, otherwise you'd just drink a cup of tea. But why drink water when you could bite it?</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>(4 bags) Earl grey tea (sub: any herbal tea)</li>

    <li>(1 cup) Cold milk (sub: oat or nut milk)</li>

    <li>Sprinkle the gelatin over the milk. Go slowly!</li>

    <li>While the tea steeps, mash the bloomed gelatin with a whisk to break up any clumps.</li>
